# ecommerce-ab-test

A ready-to-run A/B testing analysis repository for an e-commerce conversion rate test.

Contents:
- analysis/ab_test_workflow.py — main analysis workflow (two-proportion z-test, confidence intervals, visualizations)
- data/ab_test_data.csv — sample aggregate dataset (Control and Treatment)
- requirements.txt — Python dependencies
- LICENSE — MIT license

Quick start:
1. Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # (or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the analysis:
   python analysis/ab_test_workflow.py --data data/ab_test_data.csv --output outputs

This script supports both aggregate CSV (group, visitors, conversions) and row-level CSVs (user_id, group, converted), and will auto-detect the format.

Summary of what the workflow does:
- Load dataset (aggregated or row-level)
- Print group summary (visitors, conversions, conversion rate)
- Run two-proportion z-test with interpretation
- Compute and visualize 95% confidence intervals for conversion rates
- Include example code for Chi-square (categorical relationships) and t-test for continuous metrics

Notes:
- Always verify test assumptions (independence, sample size, normal approximation, equal variances for t-test).
- This repo is intended to be a template — feel free to expand with further automation, CI, or notebooks.
